silent c+h is always encouraged even if i have dni in my name, unless you're sitting near me for the sake of ships. PLEASE whisper to interact.

however, it would be appreciated if you could read below especially if you're looking to be friends :D

**byi** please use tone tags for me (specifically use /srs, /j, /hvj, /lh, /p the most). i might ramble a lot about my interests, discourse, etc so my apologies if it comes off very annoying!!. yes i am a part of a system however i do not frequently talk about it, feel free to ask questions!

**dni** if you fit basic criteria (lgbtphobic, racist, ableist, misogynistic, islamophobic, antisemitic, etc). specifically dni if you're a zionist / anti palestine. pro/com/darkshipper or condone it. in general you're an asshole.

**interact with caution if** you're an irl/da (fictkins are fine), deny queer coding in hyv games or hc queer characters as different identities (no aventurine isnt bisexual fuck you), you multiship with aventio + haikaveh + wriolette.

friends are an exception in most cases ^_^
