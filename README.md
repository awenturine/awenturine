feel free to interact without any concerns ^_^! silent c+h is always encouraged even if i have dni in my name, regardless of who you are (unless you're sitting near me for the sake of ships). PLEASE whisper to interact if i don't respond, as i am often afk or offtab.

however, it would be appreciated if you could read below especially if you're looking to be friends :D

**byi** please use tone tags for me (it often helps with paranoia, more specifically use /srs, /j, /hvj, /lh, /p the most). i might ramble a lot about my interests, discourse, or allat so my apologies if it comes off very annoying!!. yes i am a part of a system however i do not frequently talk about it.

**dni** if you fit basic criteria (lgbtphobic, racist, ableist, misogynistic, etc). HEAVY dni if you're a zionist ("neutral" or pro israel, sympathize for the people, etc. seriously fuck you). pro/com/darkshipper or condone it. dislike wriolette haikaveh && aventio. you try to claim you love wriothesley, ratio or haitham more than me (personal boundary) ;;

**interact with caution if** you're an irl/da (fictkins are fine), you ship aventurine with women and robin with men (or deny any form of queer coding in hoyo games), you multiship with aventurine / ratio / haitham / kaveh / wriothesley / neuvillette outside of the big three (i'm mostly a monoshipper for them and bitter about their other ships).
